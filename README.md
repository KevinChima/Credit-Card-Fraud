# Creadit Card Fraud Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Credit Card Fraud dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It consists of a total of 284,807 transactions, with 492 of them being fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.

The dataset can be downloaded from the following source:

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- data/: This directory contains the dataset file(s).
- notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- src/: This directory contains the source code files.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.9+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip by running the following command:

## Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/KevinChima/Credit-Card-Fraud.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/directory to explore the dataset, develop and evaluate the models.

Follow the instructions in the notebooks to train the models and evaluate their performance.

Results
The project aims to achieve the following goals:

Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compare different models and techniques for dealing with imbalanced data.
Provide insights into the factors that contribute to fraudulent transactions.
